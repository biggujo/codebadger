## Confidence & False-Positive Policy

CodeBadger's detectors assign a **Confidence** level (HIGH / MEDIUM) to each finding based on:
- Flow type (direct dereference vs passed-to-function, same-pointer vs alias, intraprocedural vs interprocedural)
- Reachability from external input (BFS depth 10 over call graph)

**Use the tool's confidence levels to structure your report:**
- **HIGH confidence** findings: Report as confirmed vulnerabilities in the main findings section. These have direct evidence (e.g., same-function usage, confirmed dataflow, direct dereference) or are reachable from external input.
- **MEDIUM confidence** findings: Include in a "Needs Manual Review" section with explanation of why they are uncertain (e.g., alias-based, passed-to-function without confirmed dereference, not reachable from external input).
- After gathering tool results, critically evaluate each finding — cross-reference with at least two signals (e.g., confirmed taint flow + dangerous sink without sanitization, or CFG shows reachable path + no bounds check).
- Discard findings that are likely false positives: dead code paths, safely wrapped calls, test-only code, or sinks that are unreachable from external input.
- Never pad the report with low-confidence noise. A short report with 3 real findings is far more valuable than a long report with 20 speculative ones.

Each finding also includes **validation context** (function signature, callers, reachability from external input) to help you write targeted PoC triggers and assess exploitability.

## Step 1: Verify Language
Call `get_codebase_summary(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}")` to confirm this is a C or C++ codebase.
If not C/C++, inform the user that memory safety checks are primarily relevant for C/C++ but offer to check for language-appropriate issues.

## Step 2: Use-After-Free Detection
Call `find_use_after_free(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}"{file_filter})` to find cases where memory is accessed after being freed.
- CWE-416: Use After Free
- For each finding, note the free() call location and the subsequent use location

## Step 3: Double-Free Detection
Call `find_double_free(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}"{file_filter})` to find cases where the same pointer is freed twice.
- CWE-415: Double Free
- For each finding, note both free() locations and the pointer involved

Call `find_taint_sinks(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}", language="c", sink_patterns=["memcpy", "strcpy", "strcat", "sprintf", "gets", "memmove", "strncpy", "strncat", "vsprintf", "sscanf"])` to find buffer-writing operations.
For each dangerous buffer operation found, call `find_bounds_checks(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}", buffer_access_location="<file>:<line>")` to check if bounds validation exists nearby.
- CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size
- CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

## Step 5: Null Pointer Dereference Detection
Call `find_null_pointer_deref(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}"{file_filter})` to find cases where pointers from allocation functions (malloc, calloc, realloc, fopen, strdup, mmap, etc.) are dereferenced without NULL checks.
- CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
- For each finding, note the allocation site and the unchecked dereference location

## Step 6: Integer Overflow Detection
Call `find_integer_overflow(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}"{file_filter})` to find arithmetic operations (multiplication, left-shift, addition, subtraction) that could overflow before being used as allocation sizes or array indices.
- CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
- For each finding, note the arithmetic expression, operation type, and risk level

## Step 7: TOCTOU Detection
Call `find_toctou(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}"{file_filter})` to find cases where a file is checked with access()/stat()/lstat() and then opened or acted on in a separate step.
- CWE-367: Use of Device File in Sensitive Operation
- For each finding, note the CHECK call location, the USE call location, and the path argument shared between them

## Step 8: Trace Data Origins
For each confirmed vulnerability, call `get_program_slice(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}", ...)` with direction="backward" to trace where the data or pointer originated.
Call `get_file_content(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}", method_name="<function>")` to view the full function context.

## Step 9: Report
Produce a memory safety report grouped by category:

### Use-After-Free (CWE-416)
For each: file:line, pointer name, free location, use location, exploitability, fix

### Double-Free (CWE-415)
For each: file:line, pointer name, first free, second free, fix

### Buffer Overflows (CWE-120/CWE-787)
For each: file:line, function called, buffer size (if determinable), bounds check present (yes/no), fix

### Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)
For each: file:line, pointer name, allocation function, dereference location, fix

### Integer Overflow (CWE-190)
For each: file:line, arithmetic expression, operation type, risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM), used as (allocation size / array index), fix

### TOCTOU Race Condition (CWE-367)
For each: file:line, check function (access/stat/…), use function (open/unlink/…), shared path argument, window (lines between check and use), fix

- Are heavily called (use `list_calls(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}")` to find high fan-in functions)

{gather_steps}

## Step 3: Security Analysis
Check the code for these security concerns (only report issues you are at least 80% confident about):

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Are external inputs validated before use? Check types, ranges, formats, and allowed values.
- Are inputs sanitized or escaped before passing to sinks (SQL, shell, HTML, file paths)?
- Call `find_taint_sources(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}")` and `find_taint_sinks(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}")` to identify input/output points in scope.

### Injection Risks
- Call `find_taint_flows(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}", mode="auto")` and filter for flows in scope.
- For each confirmed flow, call `get_program_slice(codebase_hash="{codebase_hash}", ...)` to verify there is no sanitization along the path.

### Error Handling
- Are errors caught and handled properly, or do they leak sensitive information (stack traces, paths, credentials)?
- Are there bare except/catch blocks that silently swallow errors?
- Do error paths leave resources in an inconsistent state?

### Resource Management
- Are file handles, connections, and locks properly closed/released?
- Are there potential resource leaks in error paths?

### Data Exposure
- Is sensitive data (passwords, tokens, keys, PII) logged, cached, or included in error messages?
- Are secrets hardcoded in the source code?

### Authentication & Authorization (if applicable)
- Are authentication checks present where expected?
- Can authorization be bypassed through unexpected code paths?

## Step 4: Code Review Report
Produce a structured review:

### Summary
One paragraph: overall code quality assessment and key risk areas.

### Findings
For each issue found (only 80%+ confidence):
| Severity | Category | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Critical/High/Medium/Low | Input Validation / Injection / Error Handling / etc. | file:line | What the issue is |

### Needs Manual Review (50-80% confidence)
Issues that warrant human attention but could not be confirmed automatically.

### Positive Observations
Note well-implemented security patterns (proper input validation, parameterized queries, safe error handling) to acknowledge good practices."""
